# Document Template Customizer (DTC)

This tool allows you to produce *personalized document templates* from a larger base template repository, such as https://github.com/bflorat/architecture-document-template[this one].

While I‚Äôve received good feedback on my previous document templates, a recurring criticism was that the *templates were too large*, leaving many sections unused. With DTC, you can *prepare smaller, tailored templates* filtered from a larger one.

DTC can work not only with my own templates, but also with any base document template (self-hosted or not), as long as it follows a small metamodel.

## Common use-case

. An expert (typically an *Enterprise Architect*) selects or writes a base template. This base template is usually organization-wide.
. Another expert (typically a *Solution Architect*) creates a customized, curated template for one or several projects. This includes both a *full template with explanations* and *blank documents* to be filled.
. The project team then fills the *blank documents*, guided by the explanations in the customized template.


## Features
* [ ] Option "Tout" (pas de filtre)
* [x] CLI
* [ ] Liens predefinis vers un site central (ex: contraintes) ?

## CLI usage

Build the CLI once, then generate a filtered archive:

```
npm run cli -- --base-url https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bflorat/architecture-document-template/refs/heads/feat/add-medadata  --include level::basic,persistence 
```

Options:

* `--base-url` (`-b`) ‚Äì required. The template root exposing `template-metadata.yaml`.
* `--include` (`-i`) ‚Äì comma-separated labels to keep (matching sections stay, others are pruned). Unknown labels abort the run.
* `--output` (`-o`) ‚Äì optional zip destination relative to the current directory (defaults to `custom-template.zip`).
* `--output-file` ‚Äì optional absolute or relative output path.

The generated archive contains two folders:

* `template/` keeps the filtered parts with their metadata marker lines intact.
* `blank-template/` contains the same parts reduced to section titles and AsciiDoc attributes (body text removed).

If none `--include` labels are provided, the resulting template contains every base template sections.

## History

I want to write a small project in react.js 19 that allow to compute asciidoc documents from a base asciidoc document template. It contains an url selector to select an URL that contain a 'template-metadata.yaml' file like https://github.com/bflorat/architecture-document-template/tree/feat/add-medadata/ .



Sample  template-metadata.yaml :

## Others features ?

* Ability to remove / add a specified section by number (2, 4.5...)
* Store configs (ex: set of selected labels...) so I can reopen it later
* Done: Keep all sections from the base template : just select none label
