# Document Template Customizer

This tool lets you produce *personalized document templates* from a larger base template repository, such as https://github.com/bflorat/architecture-document-template[this one].

While we have received good feedback on our previous document templates, a recurring criticism was that the *templates were too large*, leaving many sections unused. You can now *prepare smaller, tailored templates* filtered from a larger one.

Any template following a simple manifest is supported, not only our owns.


## Common use cases

. An expert (typically an *Enterprise Architect*) selects or writes a base template. This base template is usually organization-wide.
. Another expert (typically a *Senior Solution Architect*) creates a customized, curated template for one or several similar projects. This includes both a *full template with explanations* and *blank documents* to be filled (can be partially pre-filled).
. The **single project architect** or skilled team member then finishes to fill the *blank document*, guided by the explanations in the customized template.

## Installation

* A running up-to-date version is available online https://document-template-customizer.florat.net/[here], nothing to install, you just need a browser with JavaScript enabled.

* You can install this tool on premise by downloading a https://github.com/bflorat/document-template-customizer/releases[release]. Just unzip it and expose it by a Web server.

* A NGINX-based Docker image is available https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/bflorat/document-template-customizer/general[here].

## Prerequisites for a Base Template

* The template must be written in **https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/syntax-quick-reference/[Asciidoc]** 

TIP: sections can start with either `#` (Markdown-style) or `=` (AsciiDoc-style) headings.

* A **`README.adoc`** file must be present at the root of the base template URL, providing an introduction and links to the document parts.
* A **`base-template-manifest.yaml`** file must be present at the root of the base template URL. A sample is provided below. 
* All part files must be located in the same directory than the `README.adoc` file.

* `language` : IETF BCP‑47 language code (e.g., `en`, `fr`, `es`, `de`, `pt`, `it`) used to localize the “See also” text inserted for `link_to` (default to English).

* `multi_values_labels` (optional): used to define available values for multi-values labels (like `detail_level::overview`,`detail_level::in-depth`, ...).

* `files_imported_into_blank_templates` allows to import automatically static resources into the produced blank template. The `base_dir` key is mandatory for every entry. Each file path is resolved relative to `base_dir` (itself relative to the README.adoc location) and will be placed in the blank template under the same relative path.

Sample full `base-template-manifest.yaml` :

```
author: ACME
license: CC BY-SA 4.0
language: en
parts:
  - name: Application
    file: view-application.adoc
  - name: Development
    file: view-development.adoc
  - name: infrastructure
    file: view-infrastructure.adoc
multi_values_labels:
  - name: level
    available_values: [basic, intermediate, advanced]
  - name: project_size
    available_values: [small, medium, large]
files_imported_into_blank_templates:
  - base_dir: blank-templates
    files:
      - file
      - README.adoc
  - base_dir: blank-templates/resources
    files:
      - myimage.png
```

## Sections metadata

Every section of each part file of the base template should be annotated with a metadata line directly above the section title (no blank line), using an AsciiDoc comment like:

```
//🏷{"id":"74c82505-5f47-4342-8f1b-f6951d603062","labels":["level::basic","project_size::large","detail_level::abstract","context"],"link_to":["9352a89a-3f8b-4028-98d5-58fb970e01ef"]}
```

Metadata fields:

* `id`: Unique section identifier. Enables anchors and cross-references; must be unique across all parts.
* `labels`: Filtering tags used to filter sections.
** Discovered automatically from `//🏷{...}` markers.
** Can be a simple flag (e.g., `performance`).
** Multi-valued labels use the `name::value` form (e.g., `project_size::large`, `project_size::medium`, `project_size::small`). Values are discovered from usage across parts, and you can also define them (and their order) in the manifest under `multi_values_labels[].available_values`.
* `link_to`: One or more target section ids to reference. Automatically inserts a `TIP: See also …` line after the heading in both template and blank outputs. The text is localized using `language` from the manifest (e.g., fr → `Voir aussi`). Use a single id string or an array. Cross-document `xref:` links are generated when the target id belongs to another part.

TIP: See many examples in https://github.com/bflorat/architecture-document-template[this base template].


## Matching rules

- If all or no labels are selected, the resulting template is the full base template.
- Level-1 sections (single `#` or `=`) are always kept.

TIP: Example: if the base template owns a section labeled `["foo","bar"]`, this section will be kept only if both `foo` and `bar` are kept selected.

- If a parent section doesn't match, all its subsections are dropped recursively.

- If a parent section matches, each subsection is evaluated and kept only if it matches.

- A section is dropped only if one of its labels is unselected or if its parent section is dropped. A section without any label is kept only if its parent is kept.

TIP: Example: if the base template owns a section labeled `foo` and a subsection labeled `bar` : if `foo` label is selected but not `bar`, only the parent section is kept.

## Blank template content

- The blank template preserves structure (headings, anchors, attributes) and the automatic `TIP: See also …` added by `link_to`.
- Body text is omitted by default. To include pre-filled text in the blank template, wrap it in a `[PRE-FILLED]`.

Example block:

```
[PRE-FILLED]
====
This text will appear in the blank template.
You can write multiple lines here.
====
```

## Tips
* The generated zip contains a `customization-context.yaml` file with the generation date, base template URL, the disabled labels (`disabled_labels`) and dropped sections.
* A base template URL can be pre-filled using the `base_template_url` query param, example: `https://document-template-customizer.florat.net/?base_template_url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fbflorat%2Fmodele-da%2Frefs%2Fheads%2Fmaster%2F`.
